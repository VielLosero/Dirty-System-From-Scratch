# recreate The Info documentation system uses a plain text file to hold its list of menu entries. The file is located at /usr/share/info/dir. Unfortunately, due to occasional problems in the Makefiles of various packages, it can sometimes get out of sync with the info pages installed on the system. If the /usr/share/info/dir file ever needs to be recreated, the following optional commands will accomplish the task.
pushd /usr/share/info
  rm -v dir
  for f in *
    do install-info $f dir 2>/dev/null
  done
popd

# make link to udevadm to load udev at start, this will be done on the pkg.
